## Overview
This repository is a learning journal that contains a comprehensive implementation and analysis of the Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-256).

## Requirments
This notebook uses (hashlib)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html] for comparison against my own implemnetation. Upon testing hashlib seems to not work with some version of python with my implementation as expected so to ensure this notebook works correctly use ``3.12.5``
